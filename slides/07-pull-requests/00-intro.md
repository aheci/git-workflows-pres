If you agree with the following statements, it's time to submit a pull request

- Your feature functions beautifully
- Your branch name is oh so clear
- Your commit message is brief but descriptive
- You've tested your feature and are confident it will pass QA
- Your code is squeaky(ish) clean 

Your pull request should include a description of what you did and why.  Include links to any references someone might need to understand why you've done this work.  Think ahead to any questions or concerns someone might have in reviewing your code - speak to those ahead of time.

  1. make sure your code has all of the updates from the base branch
  2. resolve any conflicts your branch may have with the base branch
  3. pay attention to the base branch you select!!
      - master is for isolated code that needs to go live outside of a release cycle
      - core-dev for any features that are to release in the normal sprint cycle
