title: Code Reviews
---
When a developer is finished working on an issue, another developer looks over the code and considers questions like:

- Are there any obvious logic errors in the code?
- Looking at the requirements, are all cases fully implemented?
- Does the new code conform to existing style guidelines?
- Are there any tips I can share that could improve this code?
- If I had to edit this code right now, would I know where to start?
- Do I understand how this code works?

Performing a code review is **not** reserved for only managers or leads. Code reviews can be done by peers, managers, spectators, whoever.  This is a chance for anyone who is interested in the code base to gain an understanding of changes that are happening to it or protect against possible issues that may arise from contributed code.
