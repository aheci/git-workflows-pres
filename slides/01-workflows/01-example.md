Let's review each of the following workflows with the following scenario in mind:

### What If?

- Dev One is half way through working on a complex optimization task that has required a lot of back and forth with QA
- Dev Two & Dev Three are working together on an update to the program page template that fixes a bug in production.  They're almost done but go to lunch and eat Pho, run from the table holding their stomachs and we don't hear from them again for three days?
- Dev Four adds copy for a program that is not approved for release but needs to be reviewed by the client for approval on August 1st

How do we make sure all of these things can be worked on at the same time & deployed to production at the right time with each of the following workflows?
