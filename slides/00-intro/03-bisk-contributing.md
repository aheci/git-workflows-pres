# Goals
- Don't be a bus factor: Use sensible branch names & commit messages
- Keep the playground clean: Delete your branch once merged
- Let your commit speak for itself - One message per feature, describes the feature
- Learn from each other - peer code reviews
- Feature branch should live in the future, not the past - smell check feature branches & core branches should never be behind master
- Master is the bible - this is always a representation of what is live NOW.  Deploying it to production should never impact production
- Friends don't let friends overwrite each others code - QA builds are done from core-dev
- Resolve your own problems - resolve merge conflicts yourself.
- Rebase and squash that shit
