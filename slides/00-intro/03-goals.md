After this presentation I hope we have a better understanding of our GitHub workflow & why each of these commitments are important:
- Using sensible branch names & commit messages
- Keep the repo clean by deleting branches after they're merged
- One commit message per feature branch
- One feature per branch
- Reducing risk by making sure master is always in sync with production
- Friends don't let friends overwrite each others code - QA builds are done from core-dev
